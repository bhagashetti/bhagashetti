## 🧩 Professional Experience

### **Software Engineer II — ZeOmega (Jul 2023 – Jul 2024)**
- Built a **high-concurrency order-processing engine in Go**, leveraging goroutines, Redis distributed locks, and PostgreSQL to process **50 000+ orders/min** with **99.99 percent data consistency**.  
- **Re-architected** a Python/SQLAlchemy monolith into **8 REST + gRPC microservices**, reducing **p95 API latency by 40 percent**.  
- Deployed production clusters on **AWS EKS** with **Terraform + Karpenter**, sustaining **99.99 percent uptime** during 5 000 RPS traffic peaks.  
- Modularized AngularJS bundles using lazy-loading, cutting JavaScript payloads by 30 percent and improving p95 page-load from 2.3 s → 1.5 s.  

### **Software Engineer — Flutura (Acquired by Accenture) (Jul 2022 – Jun 2023)**
- Engineered a **Node.js microservice** ingesting **500 K Kafka msgs/min**, enriching and bulk-upserting data into MongoDB with sub-200 ms latency.  
- Implemented **GraphQL APIs** and **Redis caching**, improving response times from 500 ms → 50 ms.  
- Built a **real-time React + D3.js machine-health dashboard**, streaming 10 K msgs/min via WebSockets, reducing operator response time by 35 percent.  

### **Software Engineer — DXC Technology (Aug 2021 – Jun 2022)**
- Developed Node.js/Express APIs and optimized PostgreSQL + MongoDB models to boost query performance by 30 percent.  
- Automated CI/CD with Jenkins pipelines, reducing deployment time by 70 percent.  
- Integrated **Google Maps API** into React apps for dynamic visualization and navigation efficiency.
